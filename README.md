# AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project! This project aims to explore insights from multiple datasets including bookings, hotels, and rooms, to derive occupancy trends, revenue patterns, and booking platform preferences. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we enable informed decision-making for hotel management and business optimization.

## Project Overview

This project involves comprehensive data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and insightful analysis of AtliQ Hotels' data. Through the use of Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, we uncover valuable insights to support strategic planning and operational improvements for AtliQ Hotels.

## Key Features

- Data Exploration: Investigate the provided datasets to understand their structure, features, and relationships.
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.
- Data Transformation: Prepare the data for analysis through aggregation, merging, and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform in-depth analysis to identify occupancy trends, revenue patterns, and booking platform preferences.
- Visualization: Visualize key findings using charts, graphs, and plots for clear communication of insights.
  
### Insights Generation:
- Analyzed average occupancy rates across different room categories and room classes.
- Explored average occupancy rates per city to understand hotel occupancy trends.
- Investigated occupancy rates on weekdays versus weekends to discern booking patterns.
- Examined occupancy rates for different cities in the month of June 2022.
