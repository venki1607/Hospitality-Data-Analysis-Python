# AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project! This project aims to explore insights from multiple datasets including bookings, hotels, and rooms, to derive occupancy trends, revenue patterns, and booking platform preferences. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we enable informed decision-making for hotel management and business optimization.

## Project Overview

This project involves comprehensive data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and insightful analysis of AtliQ Hotels' data. Through the use of Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, we uncover valuable insights to support strategic planning and operational improvements for AtliQ Hotels.

## Technical & Soft Skills Applied in the Project:

### Technical Skills:

- **Data Exploration**: Conducted thorough exploration of provided datasets to understand their structure, features, and relationships, enabling informed analysis.
  
- **Data Cleaning**: Employed techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring data quality and integrity throughout the analysis process.

- **Data Transformation**: Prepared datasets for analysis through aggregation, merging, and feature engineering, facilitating meaningful insights extraction.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform in-depth analysis, identifying occupancy trends, revenue patterns, and booking platform preferences.

- **Visualization**: Generated visualizations including charts, graphs, and plots to communicate key findings effectively, enhancing stakeholder understanding and decision-making.

  ### Insights Generation:
- Analyzed average occupancy rates across different room categories and room classes.
- Explored average occupancy rates per city to understand hotel occupancy trends.
- Investigated occupancy rates on weekdays versus weekends to discern booking patterns.
- Examined occupancy rates for different cities in the month of June 2022.

### Soft Skills:

- **Strategic Insights**: Derived actionable insights to support decision-making for hotel management and business optimization, contributing to strategic planning efforts.

- **Crafting User-Centric Reports with Empathy**: Developed reports with a user-centric approach, considering the needs and perspectives of stakeholders to ensure clarity and relevance.

- **Problem-Solving**: Applied problem-solving skills to address challenges encountered during data analysis, ensuring project objectives were met effectively.

- **Developing a Structured Approach to Formulating Report-Building Strategies**: Employed a structured approach to formulate strategies for building reports, ensuring alignment with business goals and objectives while maximizing impact and utility.
